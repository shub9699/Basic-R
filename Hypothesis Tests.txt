# p value : prob of making type 1 error if we reject null hypothesis
# p < 0.05 we can safely reject null hypo 
# p = or > 0.05 , it is not safe to reject ho ; accept ho 

# p=0.02 : out of 100 cases in 2 cases if we reject ho[decision] ; ho is True [actual] 
 # it is safe to reject null hypothesis 
#the prob of making type 1 error is 2% if we reject Ho.

# p =0.8 : out of 100 times , 80 time when we reject ho [D]; ho is true [actual]
 # it is not safe to reject null hypothesis , accept ho
#the prob of making type 1 error is 80% if we reject Ho.

# p =0.5 : out of 100 times , 50 times when we reject ho [D]; ho is true[actual]
 # it is not safe to reject null hypotheis ; accept to ho 
#the prob of making type 1 error is 50% if we reject Ho.

#in our case 0.04<0.5 so it is safe to reject Ho
