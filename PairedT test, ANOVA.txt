**paired T test/dependent sample t test:-

# null hypo : time required to compute MIS before and after is similar 
# : diff in time taken to compute MIS before and after is similar to 0

# alt hypo : time required to compute MIS before and after is not similar 
# alt hypo : diff in avg time to complete MIS report is not 0 

# : diff in average is greater than 0 
# : diff in average is less than 0 
t.test(paired_t$time_before,paired_t$time_after,alternative = "greater",paired = T)

#p : 4.91e-07 : reject ho 

# mean of diff : 8.333333  
# training was effective 

# score in exam before and after training 
t.test(paired_t$time_before,paired_t$time_after,alternative = "greater",paired = T)

**Test for variance OR F test:-
# null : the variance in both the samples is similar 
#      : diff in variance for both the sample is 0 

# alt : the variance in samples is not similar 
#     : diff in variance is not equal to 0 

# variance test is two tailed 
var.test(time~group , data=var_sample, alternative="two.sided")

# F = var1/var2= 1.5434 
# p =0.45 >0.05 : accepting null hypo 

 Q. what is the relation between f value and p value ?[ direct / inverse]
# less is p value : reject null : var are diff 
# high p value : accept null : var are similar 

# f value high indicates the ratio  of var is high - sample are diff : reject hnull
# f value small : ratio of var is small - samples are similar : accept null

# null hypo : high p value and low f value 
# null hypo : rejected : low p value and high f value 
# p and f are inversly related 


**ANOVA
--note : anova uses long type data ONLY 
# null hypo : all dept have similar satindex
# alt hypo  : all dept have diff satindex

one_way_anova<-aov(satindex~dept,data = one_way)
summary(one_way_anova)
#p = 0.115 > 0.05 : accepting null
